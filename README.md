### Features:

- Companies can create profiles and create job openings with the description,requirements,experience etc.Â 

- Users can apply to these jobs,one user can apply to a job only one time

### Project Structure and Design:

- Implemented a microservices architecture utilising HTTP communication for enhanced code quality, abstraction, and exploratory purposes. Due to time limitations, an API gateway for streamlined communication and acting as a reverse proxy was not developed.

- Employed a SQL database, specifically MySQL, and utilised the Sequelize ORM due to the project's well-defined data structure and relatively moderate scale.

- Implemented secure frontend authentication by storing JWT tokens in HTTP-only cookies, ensuring enhanced security measures for user session management.

- Have also integrated swagger for api contract in AUTH Service
